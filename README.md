<h1> Clock Project âŒš</h1>

This is a front-end project that I carried out in class, <br>
where according to the time of day the time will appear, <br>
image and colors corresponding to this timetable. 
<br>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
From the time of day, which will be obtained through the function, <br>
the screen will change and display the time, photo and different colors.
<br>
<h2>Examples</h2>
